# Kappa

The kappa is a creature from Japanese folklore, often described as a water-dwelling yokai (supernatural being). Kappas are typically associated with rivers, ponds, and other bodies of water throughout Japan.

- **Appearance:** Small humanoid creatures with green, scaly skin, a beak-like mouth, webbed hands and feet, and a dish-like depression on the top of their head that holds water. They are sometimes depicted with turtle-like shells on their backs.
- **Behavior:** Kappas are tricksters; stories portray them as mischievous and sometimes dangerous. They are said to pull people (and livestock) into the water, challenge travelers to sumo wrestling, or steal a mythical organ called the *shirikodama* from victims.
- **Weaknesses & Customs:** The water in the head-dish is the source of a kappa's power—if it is spilled, the kappa becomes weakened. Many tales say a polite bow will cause a kappa to return the bow, spilling its water and allowing a human to gain the upper hand. Kappas are also said to be fond of cucumbers; offerings of cucumbers (sometimes with a person's name written on them) are found at some shrines.
- **Cultural Role:** Kappas appear in folktales, children’s stories, and modern media. They can be portrayed as malevolent or as helpful spirits who keep promises or teach skills.

Despite their fearsome reputation in some legends, kappas are a vivid part of Japan's mythic landscape and continue to inspire literature, art, and popular culture.
