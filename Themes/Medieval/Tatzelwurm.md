The Tatzelwurm (also called Stollenwurm or Bergstutz) is a creature from Alpine folklore, described as a short, serpentine beast found in mountain regions of central Europe rather than Japan. It combines features of a lizard and a cat or dragon and appears in tales from the Alps and surrounding areas.

- **Appearance:** Typically depicted as a long, legless or short-legged serpent with a cat- or dragon-like head; some accounts show two front legs with a snake-like rear, while others describe a stout, worm-like body covered in scales or coarse fur.

- **Behavior:** Reports vary widely—some stories portray the Tatzelwurm as reclusive and elusive, living in rocky crevices and high pastures, while others describe it as aggressive, capable of spitting poison or swiping at livestock and humans. Sightings are often tied to remote, mountainous locations.

- **Weaknesses & Customs:** Folktales sometimes attribute vulnerability to fire or firearms, and hunters historically left offerings or avoided certain slopes thought to be the creature’s lair. Like many regional cryptids, the Tatzelwurm’s power in lore comes from its mystery—local customs and cautionary advice grew around reported encounters.

- **Cultural Role:** The Tatzelwurm appears in Alpine oral tradition, local legends, and regional literature as a fearsome and mysterious mountain being. It figures in tourist lore, regional identity, and modern cryptozoological interest, serving as a reminder of how landscape and legend intertwine.
